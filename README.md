# ThumbnailTemplates Build Version 4

[ThumbnailTemplates](http://thumbnailtemplates.com) is a content-creator resource website for thumbnails. ThumbnailTemplates currently provides over 100 thumbnail templates for free to the public, readily available for use.

In ThumbnailTemplates Build Version 4, I'm flipping the switch and allowing content-creators to upload and share their own resources to the already strong ThumbnailTemplates library. In return ThumbnailTemplates will offer free promotion to the content creator on every resource they provide.

This project is still in early development.
